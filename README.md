# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using a Linear Regression model. The model is trained on historical housing data and deployed using Streamlit.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following key features:

🏠 LotArea: Total area of the lot.

🏗 YearBuilt: Year the house was built.

🚿 FullBath: Number of full bathrooms.

🛏 BedroomAbvGr: Number of bedrooms above ground level.

🚗 GarageCars: Number of cars the garage can hold.

💰 SalePrice: The target variable representing the selling price of the house.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

🐍 Python

📊 Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)

🤖 Scikit-learn (for model training and evaluation)

🎨 Streamlit (for building an interactive UI)

🌍 GitHub (for version control and deployment)
